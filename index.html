			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p>We are creating a game where the user has to destroy aliens spread throughout York at various landmarks, using fire engines.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The game will be created in Java, and designed for people to play at open days.
				This means it will be able to run on a standard desktop PC, and not take very long to play.</p>
